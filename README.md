## Project Write up

* First I ran out of time to finish what I wanted to for this project.  In order to calculate the average response time I was planning on using a realm DB to store each call then caculate the average on the metrics page.  However I ran into issue using realm with SwiftUI.
* I decided to use swiftUI because I am some what new to it and thought if I am going to do a project like this I might as well learn something new.  
* I used swift package manger for frameworks 
* I spent way to much time working on the list pagination in SwiftUI which was a great learning experince but that ment I didn't have time for unit tests or finishing the api response calcuation.
